dirsearch reveals a ~/music/~ path, logging in there immediately logs into an admin panel

exploit for this version of OpenNetAdmin:
https://vuldb.com/?id.146798

Was able to use this to get a ~www-data~ shell, can extract various php files and get database creds

Next:
 * upgrade the shell and connect to database?
 * use an out of the box exploit against the db?

LOLZ it turns out the ona password was also jimmy's system pass

NOTE: ALWAYS TRY PASSWORDS

running a local PHP server against /var/www/internal produces a secret login page, cracking that hash gives the pasword: 'Revealed', but it can't cat out joanna's ssh key

apparently these secret pages are being run internally, against port 52846 as *joanna*.
curling that executes the script and prints the rsa key... but it's encrypted

ssh2john and john can grab the hash of the key and crack it though: ~bloodninja~

~sudo -l~ reveals that joanna can edit a root readable file with nano, which means we can save it where we want, including to:
~/root/.ssh/authorized_keys~, while adding a public key

FIN
