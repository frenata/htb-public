* Cache

~cache.htb~ seems to be not that interesting, but a clue of the author pages suggests looking for another project: ~hms~. Sure enough, adding ~hms.htb~ to ~/etc/hosts~ reveals another VHOST page.

~dirsearch~ reveals a lot of stuff we can directly infiltrate, but none seems immediately useful.

Two example patients:
hamming:pass
davis:pass
Official users:
phimail-service:NoLogin
portal-user:NoLogin

Fortunately, 'OpenEMR' seems to be riddled with holes: https://www.open-emr.org/wiki/images/1/11/Openemr_insecurity.pdf

The discussed auth-bypass works, as does the SQLI, which allows the dumping of a bunch of tables:
 * users
 * globals
 * users_secure

The latter has a bcrypt-hashed password for ~openemr_admin~, but ~john~ cracks it: ~xxxxxx~

The hylafax RCE attack from ^ works to get a shell as ~www-data~

localhost 11211 is running memcached, so there's bound to be something useful stored there

*** root

~luffy~ has access to docker!

~docker image inspect~ on the defined image shows a defined command:

running that command provides a root shell:

~docker exec -it 744adf chroot /mnt sh~
